## Core Premise
- **Paradox is a living symbol**: a self‑inverting generator of coherence.
- **Certainty** is the constant (bound phase of total potential).
- **Possibility** is the threshold (released potential).
- **Time** is elastic mediation (return vector between expansion and compression).
- Observation is **emergent** and **bounded**; the inversion event is **beyond observation**.

## Horizons
- **Observable horizon**: physical limit of returnable information (light/causality).
- **Cognitive horizon**: epistemic limit of stable meaning/coherence.
- **Paradox lies beyond both**; it conditions them but is not contained by them.

## Local Recursion
- **Local recursion**: a subsystem’s ability to fold back into itself and continue generating cycles (thought, emotion, identity).
- **Threshold of local recursion**: when density exceeds local equilibrium, **time/causality pause locally** and potential accumulates (e.g., black holes, terminal psychological shutdowns).
- These thresholds act as **memory nodes** (stored potential) for later inversion/release.

## Collapse Bifurcation in Psyche
1. **Inward Collapse — Pause / Self‑Annihilation (end of mortal recursion)**
   - Consciousness ceases to re‑enter feedback; subjective time “halts.”
   - Analog: black‑hole certainty without re‑emergence.

2. **Outward Collapse — Expansive Expression (retaining local recursion)**
   - Energy releases as **anger, grief, creative outburst**; the loop persists.
   - Analog: fusion/radiance; density transposed into photons/elements (distributed certainty).

**Time’s elasticity** is the differentiator: more elasticity → outward, expressive collapse; none → inward, terminal pause.

## Dynamics & Energetics
- **Fusion doesn’t erase density**: it **redistributes** it as heat, photons, and elements that later **re‑aggregate** by gravity/time.
- **Black holes** = **thresholds of local recursion**: stored certainty awaiting a future inversion.
- Energetic outcome at the **certainty event** is **open** (unprescribed): whether equal/more/less than stored potential is **beyond observation**.

## Emergence Sequence
1. **Certainty → Possibility (self‑inversion)** — pre‑temporal, pre‑observational.
2. **Density & emptiness ripple** — curvature/tension seeds geometry.
3. **Big‑Bang‑like event** — threshold ignition; spacetime expansion.
4. **Observation becomes possible** — local horizons form; relation and sequence arise.

*Bidirectionality*: at collapse, either pole (density/emptiness) may locally dominate; the universe emerges **between** their infinities.

## Cosmic ↔ Psychological Mapping
| Cosmic Process | Psychological Correlate | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Black hole (density wins) | Inward pause/self‑annihilation | Certainty without motion; end of local recursion |
| Fusion (expansion wins) | Anger, grief, expression | Distributed release that preserves recursion |
| Big Bang (perfect balance) | Transformational breakthrough | Threshold ignition to new organization |
| Wormholes/bridges | Sudden reframing/insight | Nonlinear passages between states (kept as possibilities) |

## Key Diagrams
### A. Paradox Field
```
[Density] ←—— Possibility (threshold/event horizon) ——→ [Emptiness]
                 ▲
                 │  (Time — elastic mediation/return)
                 ▼
             Certainty (constant)
```

### B. Psychological Bifurcation at Collapse
```
             Threshold of Local Recursion

        (end local recursion)        (retains local recursion)
```

## Principles / Axioms
1. **Self‑inversion**: certainty saturates → collapses into possibility; possibility saturates → calcifies into certainty.
2. **Openness**: energetics across the certainty event are extra‑observational (unprescribed).
3. **Fractality**: recursion is **nested** (local thresholds within global cycles).
4. **Conservation by transposition**: density persists via redistribution (photons/elements) and later re‑aggregation.
5. **Elastic time** governs whether collapse ends or transforms recursion.

## Glossary
- **Certainty** — bound phase of total potential; the constant.
- **Possibility** — released phase of certainty; threshold storing potential.
- **Density** — certainty of presence; gravity/mass; inward vector.
- **Emptiness** — certainty of absence; expansion/vacuum; outward vector.
- **Time** — bounded infinite reduction; elastic mediation/return.
- **Local recursion** — a subsystem’s continuing self‑feedback cycles.
- **Threshold of local recursion** — local certainty well; storage of potential.
- **Cognitive/Observable horizons** — limits of meaning/light; paradox beyond both.

## One‑Page Recap
- The psyche mirrors the cosmos: collapse bifurcates into **inward pause** (ending local recursion) or **outward expression** (anger/grief) that **retains recursion**.
- **Black holes** are **thresholds of local recursion**; **fusion** redistributes density rather than erasing it.
- **Time’s elasticity** decides direction at collapse.
- Energetics at the certainty event remain **beyond observation**, keeping the model **open and non‑dogmatic**.
